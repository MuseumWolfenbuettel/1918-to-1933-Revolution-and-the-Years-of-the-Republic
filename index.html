            November 1918 marked not only the end of the First World War but also the collapse of the German Empire and the Duchy of Brunswick. Under pressure from revolutionary movements, the monarchies abdicated, and the republic was proclaimed in both Berlin and Braunschweig.
The Weimar Republic became Germany’s first parliamentary democracy, elected by both men and women under the principles of proportional representation. While its constitutional framework granted significant fundamental rights, irreconcilable political conflicts and extreme social inequalities persisted.
The expansion of democratic participation was evident in milestones such as women’s suffrage and workplace co-determination. Rapid technological advancements, such as the development of airplanes and automobiles, along with creative breakthroughs like those of the Bauhaus movement, unleashed transformative forces. Politics and society embraced the newfound freedoms to improve working and living conditions.
However, the Weimar Republic was also plagued by near-civil-war conditions, coups such as the Hitler-Ludendorff Putsch on November 9, 1923, the resolution of hyperinflation in 1923/24, and the subsequent economic recovery. The Great Depression, which began in 1929, brought mass unemployment, the erosion of parliamentary democracy through presidential cabinets, and growing political radicalism, all of which shook the young democracy to its core.
In Wolfenbüttel, anti-republican right-wing parties dominated. The local chapter of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP), established in 1922 as the first in the state of Brunswick, undermined the achievements of democracy with its antisemitic policies and opposition to the organized labor movement. With insufficient democratic forces in politics, administration, and the military, and due to the abandonment of democracy by the bourgeois elites, enemies of the republic gained the upper hand after 1930.
